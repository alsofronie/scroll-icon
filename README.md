# Scroll Icon

> This is a little more than a gist.

I've found this little icon to be very useful when animated. You can use it as a link or just to indicate the presence of more content when presenting the user with a full page image or slider.

Although it can be used directly, it is intended for customization for each task and design.

## Use it right away

Download [minified, only 1.5k](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alsofronie/scroll-icon/master/dist/scroll-icon.min.css) or [normal css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alsofronie/scroll-icon/master/dist/scroll-icon.css) and use it directly in your page:

```
...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="scroll-icon.min.css" />
...
<span class="scroll-icon"></span>
...
```

## Customize it

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/alsofronie/scroll-icon.git) or [download the zip](https://github.com/alsofronie/scroll-icon/archive/master.zip) (you need to unzip it first).
Make sure you `cd` into the `scroll-icon` folder and use `npm` and `gulp` to compile the less file.

```
git clone https://github.com/alsofronie/scroll-icon.git
cd scroll-icon
npm install
grunt
```
